# Contributing

If you've never made a pull request, check out this [how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4) for a primer on making PRs on Github. And hop onto the [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw) while you're at it. 

1) Open a new issue explaining the features you'd like to add or bugs you'd like to fix, or comment on an existing issue and express your desire to make a PR against it. 
2) Fork the repo
3) If you don't have it already, [install commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) and use it for your commits (`git cz`)
4) Create a new branch for your PR (e.g. `git checkout -b feature-add-nyan-cat'` or `git checkout -b 'bug-fix-unit-tests'`)
5) Make your PR

New contributors welcome! Just let me know if you have any questions.
